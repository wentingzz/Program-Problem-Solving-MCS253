# MCS 253P LAB 1

## Requirements
- Write a program in C++, Java, or Python called `average` that reads a series of numbers from a specified file and prints their average.
- The file name should be provided as an argument to the program.
- The program should work with input files of any length, including empty files.
- No function can be over 5 lines long.
- Use top-down stepwise refinement and incremental development.
- Do not copy code from any source.

## Example
### Input File (numbers.dat)
```
10.0
1.0
8.0
5.0
4.0
3.0
6.0
2.0
7.0
9.0
```

### Sample Run
```commandline
python average.py numbers.dat
```
The average of the 10 numbers in file “numbers.dat” is 5.5

## Notes
- Use top-down development for better program comprehension.
- Inventing a new function grants an additional 5 lines.
